Genopts is script for generating nice GNU getopt-like bash-only parsers
in scripts.

Features:
- Meta language for switch description.
- Automatic generating of --help and --version string.
- Pure bash coding - no external utilitiesd needed.
­ NLS support.
- No docs yet, but complete example added.

Do ./genopts genopts_example and watch what was happened.
Then do ./genopts_example --help and continue in testing.

Only NLS isn't added in this example:
@textdomain nlsdomain
causes enabling NLS on all strings with defined TEXTDOMAIN.
